# Tutorial: Create your own Homebrew script


### FYI: You will want to change each of these words to suit your needs as they appear below

#### The repo is called 
  
    homebrew_formula_example

#### My github handle is 

    un5t0ppab13

#### The scripts name is 

    example_cmd

#### Create a new github repo and make sure to create a README.md

    open https://github/new

#### Follow githubs steps as suggested.... ie

    echo "# homebrew_formula_example" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/un5t0ppab13/homebrew_formula_example.git
    git push -u origin master

#### For the purposes of this tutorial we will create a folder and enter it

  mkdir ~/homebrew_scripts
  cd ~/homebrew_scripts

#### Clone that repo wherever you want it locally stored on your machine
    git clone https://github.com/un5t0ppab13/homebrew_formula_example.git
  cd homebrew_formula_example

#### Create a script, this is a simple one that just echos upon running

  echo '#!/bin/sh
  echo "Some example text shown when user runs the command: example_cmd"' > example_cmd

#### Change its permissions and run it

  chmod u+x example_cmd
  ./example_cmd

#### Tag that repo with a version

  git tag 1.0.0
  git push --tags

#### Go ahead and add, commit, push

  git add .
  git commit -am "second"
  git push          # git push origin master

#### Open the following link (again change username and repo first)

  https://github.com/un5t0ppab13/homebrew_formula_example/releases
  
This is the format https://github.com/username/reponame/releases

#### Right click the tar.gz option and copy link address 

Now this is in the clipboard run the command
 
  brew create https://github.com/un5t0ppab13/homebrew_formula_example/archive/1.0.0.tar.gz

#### This creates this file which you need to edit

  /usr/local/Library/Formula/homebrew_formula_example.rb

# 1. Delete all comments
# 2. And everything between def install ...... end
# 3. Paste this inside of that def

    bin.install "example_cmd"

Again remember to use your command name not mine

#### Now you reinstall 

  brew reinstall homebrew_formula_example

It downloads to: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/homebrew_formula_example-1.0.0.tar.gz

üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/homebrew_formula_example/1.0.0

#### Verify this worked with the following

  which example_cmd

It should say something like /usr/local/bin/example_cmd

You should now be able to run

  example_cmd
 
At this point you do not need a local copy of the repo if you do not want it
